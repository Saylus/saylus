      model:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class = "section">
      <h1>Cost</h1>
      <p>The most important component of cost is the cost of <br>raw materials:</p>

        <img src = "./res/coststable.png" />
        <figcaption>Other variable cost will include cost of production like wages etc. which is estimated to be Rs 100 per piece.
        <br>So, the band will cost Rs 700 per piece to the company.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class = "section black">
      <h1>Revenue Streams</h1>
      <p>There will be three main streams of revenue which are as follows:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Sale of The Band</li>
        <p>Two Level Distribution Chain: The band will be sold through different distribution channel. One among them is two level
        distribution chain. The entire chain with profit margins is given below. It has been approximated that the sale through
        retailers will be started after 2 years of establishment.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src = "./res/salestable1.png" />
          <figcaption>The cost of the band to the consumer will be Rs 1099.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>E-Commerce Websites: The band will also be sold to the consumers through e-commerce websites. The entire chain in such a
        distribution channel is shown below.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src = "./res/salestable2.png" />
          <figcaption>The profit to our company will be Rs251 (399-148) which is 35.8%.
          The cost of the band to the consumer will be Rs 1099.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>NGOs: The band will also be sold to various NGOs working for women empowerment at a lesser profit for the benefit of
        those who cannot purchase it. The chain of distribution is given below.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src = "./res/salestable3.png" />
          <figcaption>The cost of the band to the consumer will be Rs 845.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <li>Subscriptions</li>
        <p>The other main source of revenue will be subscription which will be charged from the users for the usage of our services
        like cloud services etc. We will provide our users with different amount of subscriptions. These different amounts will
        be equipped with different features. The least amount of subscription will be equipped with basic features required to
        save the life of the victim. As the amount of subscription will increase there will be various add-ons.</p>
        <li>Affiliate Marketing</li>
        <p>We will be displaying links of products produced by other manufacturers which we believe will help to make the society a
        better place, on our app. We will be charging 5% of the selling price as commission from the manufacturer for any
        purchase made through the link provided in our app.</p>

        Marketing is essential for any budding venture. As such, we have carefully and prudentially selected the following marketing strategies to appeal to and reach out to our demographics:

    <div class = "section">
      <div class = "marketing-flex">
        <div>
          <h1>Niche Marketing</h1>
          <p>The concept of Niche Marketing is delivering specific product at a specific price to a specific customer. Our target
          audience is limited to women of lower middle to upper middle households. We have identified two specific places for our products where we can sell it to our target audience.</p>
        </div>
        <figure>
          <img src = "res/nichemarketing-1.jpg" />
          <figcaption>First identified place is a carnival or festival in a school/college or any other such gathering.</figcaption>

      </div>
      <figure>
        <img src = "res/nichemarketing-2.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Second place that we find appropriate is an NGO.</figcaption>

        </figure>
        <div>
          <h1>Social Media Marketing</h1>
          <p>We will be actively using websites like Blogger, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. to promote and market our product. As per the cost analysis the best among them are Google adwords, Quora, Instagram, Twitter and Text messages. Text messages have become old and can’t be effective in gaining a market for our product.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="marketing-flex">
        <div>
          <h1>Trade Show Marketing</h1>
          <p>We will be involved in marketing products at trade shows, markets and supermarkets. Considering the huge number of
          customers passing by it, it can be useful. We’ll look for trade shows which specialize in both technology and socially
          helpful products.</p>
        </div>
        <figure>
          <img src = "res/tradeshows.jpg" />
          <figcaption>Trade Shows are a very effective tool to approach a huge audience and are not very expensive as well.</figcaption>

        <div>
          <h1>Digital Media Marketing</h1>
          <p>We will be using Search Engine Optimization initially to make our presence online. Search Engine Optimization will help
          to make our website’s link flash at the top. Search Engine Optimization is costly but effective because people tend to click on links that are present first. This marketing technique can be used in the long run to promote our product.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "section">
      <h1>Commercials</h1>
      <p>Commercials are also very expensive particularly for a start-up to bear. If we go for a proper advertisement with a good
      production house and actors we may have to spend up to ₹ 10Lakhs. If we go for a medium range production house we will
      have to spend ₹ 5Lakhs which is also expensive for our product. The most efficient option at present that we have is
      shooting our advertisement ourselves which can be effective. This would cost us around ₹ 5000 only.</p>
      <div class = "marketing-flex">
        <div>
          <h1>Review Marketing</h1>
          <p>We will offer our product to Bloggers and You Tubers who can review them and post them online. Review marketing is cheap and can be effective for a start up. We can use it to influence and persuade people to buy our product.</p>

      </div>
      <h1>Undercover/Buzz Marketing</h1>
      <p>This includes creating hype or increasing curiosity of the product in the market that attracts customers fast. Analyzing
      the cost of undercover marketing is very difficult. Some notable points under buzz marketing are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Influencers</li>
        <p>We can take help from various journalists and other people who are working for the society to write stories and articles
        on our product to create a hype for it and make it easy for us to sell. This may be a little costly.</p>
        <li>NGO</li>
        <p>This work can also be done by NGOs working towards women empowerment. These NGOs can help us in selling and promoting
        our product. This wouldn’t be costly as well.</p>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        We have also analyzed various other marketing techniques like cross marketing etc. but did not find them
        feasible and viable for our company.<br><br>
