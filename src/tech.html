        Despite an increase in the freedom granted to girls today, a major issue
        of concern remains for their parents for sending them alone – Security.
        With the number of cases of Women harassment in India and other
        countries increasing, the use of modern technology to ensure the safety
        of women is imperative. The proposed system for the safety of women
        consists of a set of wearable devices - a bracelet and a necklace -
        which operates automatically on voice recognition. The voice is
        recognized by AIbased software and serves as constant security for
        women. On trigger, a message is sent to the contacts selected by the
        person including the location and other details, a fake call is
        generated, and voice recording is initiated to serve as proof of the
        incident. This is monitored through an application on the phone.
      </p>

    <div id="tech-info2">
      <center><h1>Introduction</h1></center>
      <p>
        Women in India, although being regarded as Goddess Lakshmi, are
        frequently harassed. Women safety remains an important issue in India,
        and despite the formation of various rules and regulations, such cases
        continue to keep on increasing day by day. Such cases have also reduced
        the morale and confidence of women in India. A step towards curbing this
        heinous crime is the development of a device that can sense impending
        danger and help in rescuing the victims from such an act. Research shows
        that such devices exist commercially but requires manual pressing of a
        button to trigger the alarm. Since the mental state of women as well is
        children is affected during such act consequently manual pressing of the
        button is not ideal. Hence an AI-based device is the need of the hour.
        Thus we have built a mobile application along with compatible devices –
        Bracelet and Necklace. A microphone in the device picks up the voice of
        the user and sends it to the mobile application via Bluetooth, where it
        is analyzed and if the words match the preset requirement, the safety
        program is triggered which sends messages to selected contacts,
        generates a fake call, and engages voice recording. Also, this message
        is sent across on the app, thus providing a social platform for help.

      <center><h1>Literature Survey</h1></center>
      <p>
        Projects like VithUapp, Nirbhaya, Spot N Save Feel Secure app was
        introduced lately. But most of them had many disadvantages over the
        advantages. Firstly the concept was done by the app VithU mobile app. In
        case of an emergency, Alert messages are sent to the listed contacts,
        which can be saved before itself. But the disadvantage of this app is
        that we have to click the power button 2 times consecutively, which is
        not possible in every situation. Nirbhaya can send a distress message to
        a specified contact group in an emergency confronting a woman. The major
        drawback of this app also is that it is physically dependent, that is
        not possible in all situations. Spot N Save Feel Secure app is a special
        portable smart band that works along with an app. It works by clicking
        on the button on the band twice to send out a signal to the guardian
        network. It is not applicable in all situations since for an unnoticed
        situation or unpredictable time, users can’t make alerts previously by
        clicking it twice. In our paper, this device can be carried while
        traveling. Alert message notification and calling option is available in
        this mobile app. This mobile app also provides an extra facility of
        cancel option. Since it uses an AI, it eliminates the requirement of
        physical contact.

      <h1>Arduino UNO</h1>
      <p>
        The Arduino UNO is considered as a basic
development board to create digital devices
and interactive objects that send and control
physical devices. The board is embedded
with sets of digital and analog input/output
(I/O) pins that may be interfaced with various
shields and other circuits. The board consists
of 14 Digital pins and 6 Analog pins. It is
programmable with the Arduino IDE, which is
an open-source software via a type B USB
cable. It is powered using a USB cable or by
an external 55-volt battery. The ATmega328
on the Arduino Uno comes pre-programmed
with a boot-loader that allows uploading new
code to it without the use of an external
hardware programmer.

      <h1>Microphone</h1>
      <p>
        A microphone is a device – a transducer –
        that converts sound into an electrical signal.
        Microphones are used in many applications
        such as telephones, hearing aids, public
        address systems for concert halls and public
        events, motion picture production, life and
        recorded audio engineering, two-way adios,
        mic, radio a, and television broadcasting, and
        in computers for recording voice, speech
        recognition, VoIP, and for non-acoustic
        purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock
        sensors.

      <h1>Bluetooth Module</h1>
      <p>
        The Bluetooth transceiver module is used as
        a UART RS232 serial converter module. It
        can easily transfer the UART data through
        the wireless Bluetooth, without complex piece
        layout or deep knowledge in the Bluetooth
        software stack, can also connect this
        Bluetooth module with devices such as MCU,
        ARM or DSP systems, GPS or GSM, Sensor
        modules, SOC systems.

      <h1>GPS Module</h1>
      <p>
        GPS stands for Global Positioning System by
        which anyone can always obtain the position
        information anywhere in the world. Firstly, the
        signal of time is sent from a GPS satellite at a
        given point. Subsequently, the time difference
        between GPS time and the point of the time
        clock in which GPS receiver receives the time
        signal will be calculated to generate the
        distance from the receiver to the satellite. The
        same process will be done with three other
        available satellites. It is possible to calculate
        the position of the GPS receiver from
        distance from the GPS receiver to three
        satellites.

      <center><h1>Methodology (Software)</h1></center>
      <p>
        As the crimes against women are increasing
        day by day, this system is very helpful since it
        is very portable. When the mic picks up the
        code words, it connects with the mobile app
        to enact the set protocols. The emergency
        contacts are already saved in the app and
        messages are sent to them. A fake call,
        which had been previously recorded is played
        on the mobile phone. A voice roister starts
        recording to serve as proof in case the matter
        is taken to court. There is a cancel option
        available on the app for the 15 seconds after
        the activation.

      <center><h1>Conclusion</h1></center>
      <p>
        In our system, we developed one smart band
        which contains a microphone and GPS and is
        continuously communicating with the
        smartphone. This system does not require
        any user interaction at a time of the critical
        situation. It sends an emergency message
        automatically to the relatives and nearby
        people. Our system is more efficient than all
        existing systems.

      <center><h1>The (not-so-distant) Future</h1></center>
      <p>
        In the future, we plan to add multiple new
        features, most of them to make our device
        independent of the smartphone interface, so
        that it can be used even when one does not
        have her phone.
        For this purpose, we plan to include an LTESIM module which helps our device to
        connect the internet directly without the use
        of a phone. Due to the presence of a SIM
        card, each user can be recognized
        distinctively and appropriate action can thus
        be taken.
        The benefits of the above-mentioned system
        are numerous. In case of loss of phone or
        when one does not take their phone with
        them, the device would still be functional. As
        power has become a major problem these
        days, the device would be functional even
        when the phone battery dies.
        Other future endeavours would include the
        cooperation of the police to provide aid to
        potential victims as soon as possible. This
        would yield benefits for the police as well, as
        it would become easier to catch the
        perpetrators.
        We also plan to add a High-Frequency
        Buzzer as a safety measure for women which
        can be used to drive the person away.
        A Micro Camera can also be included in this
        device to further the proof for a court case. It
        can also be used as a measure to prevent the
        misuse of the device.
        A feature to send a message to the people
        nearby in the area can also prove effective in
        case of an emergency, and hence will be
        considered for an upgrade in the future.
        We are working to develop a safe GPS Route
        feature in our application which would work
        mostly like Google Maps but would work by
        focusing more on secure routes than short
        routes. We will provide a section on the maps
        where we show the user hotspots and safe
        spots and would be highly useful.
        The application will be embedded with a high
        alert mode that can be activated by going on
        the app or by automatic it that will take data
        from GPS and according to it if the user is in
        hot spots or places like clubs, it will be
        automatically activated and the location
        sharing to trusted contacts will immediately
        begin
