        Despite an increase in the freedom granted to girls today, a major issue
        of concern remains for their parents for sending them alone – Security.
        With the number of cases of Women harassment in India and other
        countries increasing, the use of modern technology to ensure the safety
        of women is imperative. The proposed system for the safety of women
        consists of a set of wearable devices - a bracelet and a necklace -
        which operates automatically on voice recognition. The voice is
        recognized by AIbased software and serves as constant security for
        women. On trigger, a message is sent to the contacts selected by the
        person including the location and other details, a fake call is
        generated, and voice recording is initiated to serve as proof of the
        incident. This is monitored through an application on the phone.

      <h1>Arduino UNO</h1>
      <p>
        The Arduino UNO is considered as a basic development board to create
        digital devices and interactive objects that send and control physical
        devices. The board is embedded with sets of digital and analog
        input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced with various shields and
        other circuits. The board consists of 14 Digital pins and 6 Analog pins.
        It is programmable with the Arduino IDE, which is an open-source
        software via a type B USB cable. It is powered using a USB cable or by
        an external 55-volt battery. The ATmega328 on the Arduino Uno comes
        pre-programmed with a boot-loader that allows uploading new code to it
        without the use of an external hardware programmer.

      <h1>Microphone</h1>
      <p>
        A microphone is a device – a transducer – that converts sound into an
        electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as
        telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and
        public events, motion picture production, life and recorded audio
        engineering, two-way adios, mic, radio a, and television broadcasting,
        and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition, VoIP, and for
        non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.

      <h1>Bluetooth Module</h1>
      <p>
        The Bluetooth transceiver module is used as a UART RS232 serial
        converter module. It can easily transfer the UART data through the
        wireless Bluetooth, without complex piece layout or deep knowledge in
        the Bluetooth software stack, can also connect this Bluetooth module
        with devices such as MCU, ARM or DSP systems, GPS or GSM, Sensor
        modules, SOC systems.

      <h1>GPS Module</h1>
      <p>
        GPS stands for Global Positioning System by which anyone can always
        obtain the position information anywhere in the world. Firstly, the
        signal of time is sent from a GPS satellite at a given point.
        Subsequently, the time difference between GPS time and the point of the
        time clock in which GPS receiver receives the time signal will be
        calculated to generate the distance from the receiver to the satellite.
        The same process will be done with three other available satellites. It
        is possible to calculate the position of the GPS receiver from distance
        from the GPS receiver to three satellites.

      <p>
        As the crimes against women are increasing day by day, this system is
        very helpful since it is very portable. When the mic picks up the code
        words, it connects with the mobile app to enact the set protocols. The
        emergency contacts are already saved in the app and messages are sent to
        them. A fake call, which had been previously recorded is played on the
        mobile phone. A voice roister starts recording to serve as proof in case
        the matter is taken to court. There is a cancel option available on the
        app for the 15 seconds after the activation.

      <center><h1>Conclusion</h1></center>
      <p>
        In our system, we developed one smart band which contains a microphone
        and GPS and is continuously communicating with the smartphone. This
        system does not require any user interaction at a time of the critical
        situation. It sends an emergency message automatically to the relatives
        and nearby people. Our system is more efficient than all existing
        systems.

      <center><h1>The (not-so-distant) Future</h1></center>
      <p>
        In the future, we plan to add multiple new features, most of them to
        make our device independent of the smartphone interface, so that it can
        be used even when one does not have her phone. For this purpose, we plan
        to include an LTESIM module which helps our device to connect the
        internet directly without the use of a phone. Due to the presence of a
        SIM card, each user can be recognized distinctively and appropriate
        action can thus be taken. The benefits of the above-mentioned system are
        numerous. In case of loss of phone or when one does not take their phone
        with them, the device would still be functional. As power has become a
        major problem these days, the device would be functional even when the
        phone battery dies. Other future endeavours would include the
        cooperation of the police to provide aid to potential victims as soon as
        possible. This would yield benefits for the police as well, as it would
        become easier to catch the perpetrators. We also plan to add a
        High-Frequency Buzzer as a safety measure for women which can be used to
        drive the person away. A Micro Camera can also be included in this
        device to further the proof for a court case. It can also be used as a
        measure to prevent the misuse of the device. A feature to send a message
        to the people nearby in the area can also prove effective in case of an
        emergency, and hence will be considered for an upgrade in the future. We
        are working to develop a safe GPS Route feature in our application which
        would work mostly like Google Maps but would work by focusing more on
        secure routes than short routes. We will provide a section on the maps
        where we show the user hotspots and safe spots and would be highly
        useful. The application will be embedded with a high alert mode that can
        be activated by going on the app or by automatic it that will take data
        from GPS and according to it if the user is in hot spots or places like
        clubs, it will be automatically activated and the location sharing to
        trusted contacts will immediately begin
